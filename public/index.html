                    <h2 class="h2">By 1901, nearly 120,000 people were living in Preston, now a booming industrial town.

                      <h2 class="h2"> New industries arrived in Preston during the interwar years which helped ease the pain felt through the sharp decline of the cotton industry.<br></h2><br></h2>

                    <p class="scrolling-p">The River Ribble provides a southern border for the city. The Forest of Bowland forms a backdrop to Preston to the northeast while the Fylde lies to the west. At 53°45′N 2°42′W, Preston is approximately 27 miles (43 km) north west of Manchester, 26 miles (42 km) north east of Liverpool, and 15 miles (24 km) east of the coastal town Blackpool.</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">The current borders came into effect on 1 April 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972 merged the existing County Borough of Preston with Fulwood Urban District as an unparished area within the Borough of Preston. Preston was designated as part of the Central Lancashire new town in 1970.</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">The climate of Preston is of a temperate maritime type, with a narrow range of temperatures, similar to the rest of the British Isles. Being relatively close to the Irish sea, this is more pronounced than areas to the south and east of Preston. The official Met Office weather station is located at Moor Park, less than 1 mile (1.6 km) north of the city centre, and surrounded by built up areas, suggesting a degree of urban warming is likely, particularly during clear and calm nights.</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">The demonym for residents of the city is "Prestonian", and the centre of the city is referred to by residents colloquially as "The Gate"</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">Retail is also a major contributor to Preston's economy. The city's main high streets are Fishergate and Friargate which offer shops, bars and restaurants with many more tucked away down the side streets. Two major shopping centres are located along the high streets:</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">Five main bus operators serve Preston. Preston Bus, formerly the city's municipal bus company, served the district and operated a route between Preston and Penwortham. In October 2006, Preston Bus started operating two orbital bus routes</p>

                    <p class="scrolling-p">Todmorden is a market town and civil parish[3] in the Upper Calder Valley in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. It is 17 miles (27 kilometres) north east of Manchester and in 2011 had a population of 15,481.[4]</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">Todmorden is at the confluence of three steep-sided Pennine valleys and is surrounded by moorlands with outcrops of sandblasted gritstone.</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">The historic boundary between Yorkshire and Lancashire is the River Calder and its tributary, the Walsden Water, which run through the town. The administrative border was altered by the Local Government Act 1888 placing the whole of the town within the West Riding.</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">Throughout the first decade of the 20th century, the population of the Borough of Todmorden remained constant. The ten-yearly UK census returns show figures of 25,418 in 1901 and 25,404 in 1911. Like the rest of the Upper Calder Valley, Todmorden's economy experienced a slow decline from around the end of the First World War onwards, accelerating after the Second World War until around the late 1970s. During this period there was a painful restructuring of the local economy with the closure of mills and the demise of heavy industry.</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">On 1 January 1907, Todmorden Corporation became only the second municipality in the British Isles to operate a motor bus service. By the end of that year, the fleet had expanded to five double-deck vehicles: two by Critchley-Norris, two by Lancashire Steam (predecessor of Leyland Motors) and one by Ryknield. In 1931, the service became jointly operated by the Corporation and the LMS railway under the name "Todmorden Joint Omnibus Committee". At its maximum size in the 1940s and 1950s, the undertaking operated 40 vehicles over 50 route miles (80 km) through the rugged South Pennine terrain.</p>
                    <p class="scrolling-p">Until 1996, when postal counties were abolished, Todmorden's official postal county was Lancashire.</p>
